In our project we built a scrabble game which supports two different game forms:
1. Local game on a single computer.
2. Playing with remote players.

**Milestone 1:**
In Milestone 1 we focused on the communication protocol between the server and the host and between the host and the other guest players. Later we will implement the aesthetic part and how things look in terms of user interface and view-model.
