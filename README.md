Scrabble Game

Scrabble is a board game inspired by crosswords. In this game, two to four players create words on a 15x15 grid using game boards with letters printed on them. The goal is to accumulate points, where the number of points the player wins in each move depends on the fixed score for each letter, the type of squares in which the letters were placed, and the number of standard words they created on the board.

In our project, there is support for two different game modes: a local game where several players play from hundreds of computers, and a remote game where several players play from their own computers. As a result, there are two types of players: host and guest.

A command-line Scrabble game implemented in Java.

**Milestone 1:**
In Milestone 1 we focused on the communication protocol between the server and the host and between the host and the other guest players. Later we will implement the aesthetic part and how things look in terms of user interface and view-model.
